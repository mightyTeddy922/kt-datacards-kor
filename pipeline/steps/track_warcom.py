"""Front-end (warcom track): scrape + coordinate-map per-card split.

scrape site  ->  layers/warcom/staging/*.pdf
                 ->  layers/warcom/extracted/{team}/cards/*.pdf  (per-card split)

Standalone implementation. The low-level work lives in the local
``warcom`` package:

  - scrape:  warcom.scraper        (Playwright + requests)
  - split:   warcom.card_extractor (template/marker per-card PDF split, PDF only)

The scrape downloads ALL team-rules PDFs from the kill-team page; team identity is
read from PDF content afterwards. When --teams is given we filter the scraped URLs
by team slug (the slug appears in the PDF filename) to avoid pulling every team.

Token extraction is intentionally NOT done here. Tokens are produced once per team
by the shared ``extract_tokens`` step.
