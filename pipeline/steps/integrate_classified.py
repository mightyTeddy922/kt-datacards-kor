"""Integration — shared merge point. Copy + rename extracted PDFs into one folder.

layers/{track}/extracted + layers/{track}/structure/{team}-structure.json
   ->  layers/integration/{team}/{team}-{type}-{name}.pdf   (no -front/-back postfix)

Both tracks emit the IDENTICAL file set here. This is the dedup/merge point: run
whichever source GW updated and downstream is source-agnostic.

Uses the structure manifest to map each track's (differently named) extracted PDF
to its canonical classified filename. Each card becomes ONE classified PDF: a
front-only card is a 1-page PDF; a front+back card is a 2-page PDF (front, back).

When an entity has more than one physical card (e.g. a datacard whose actions are
on their own cards, or a multi-card faction rule), the card number is appended to
keep filenames unique: {team}-{type}-{name}-{card_number}.pdf.

The source only selects which track's structure/extracted to read. Conflict
policy when both tracks ran a team: last-run-wins (files are overwritten).
